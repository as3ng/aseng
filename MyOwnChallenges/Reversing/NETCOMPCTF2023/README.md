## Description
Welcome to Pokemon Game! üê¢

There are 3 **hidden type** Pokemons which hold the partial FLAG for each one. Your objective is to try to get and `capture them`!

Note that this pokemon appearance possibility is very much likely impossible since the Game Developer only allows you to fight one time üçô.

Remember folks no `stegash-i..` involved.
